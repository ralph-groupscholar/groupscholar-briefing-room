# Group Scholar Briefing Room Progress

## Iteration 1
- Created the initial Briefing Room microsite with a narrative hero, pulse cards, program cadence timeline, and CTA.
- Built a bold visual system using Fraunces + Space Grotesk, layered gradients, and animated briefing card.
- Captured core modules: pulse board, scholar journey, partner readiness, and leadership asks.
- Deployed to https://groupscholar-briefing-room.vercel.app.

## Iteration 2
- Added a briefing focus section to surface risks, experiments, and partner commitments in a single scan.
- Designed new insight cards with decision-log framing, ownership, and due dates to keep the brief actionable.
